# Generative-Vision-Modeling
# Purpose of This Repository

The main focus of this repository is providing a generative image modeling path, more specifically an up to date tutorial set for image-video generation and image&video - text alignment. This repository will be containing useful experiment kit for training image&video generation, reconstruction, image to image modeling and more.

This repository is still under development. At the same time, trainings for the developed modules is ongoing. Due to limited computational power(A Single 3090), it may take a long time to complete.

# Logs are the boats on the ocean
I believe that providing relative logs with their configs is important. Due to the limited energy resources of earth and computational power of humanity,I aim to prevent unnecessary resource usage by sharing the logs and configs of all trainings I have completed experiments for.

## AI Assist
While developing this repository and relative algorithms, I used some AI assistants. Most of the time I use Grok 3, while Grok 3 is better at coding and debugging, DeepSeek V3 is able to come up with super cool ideas.
